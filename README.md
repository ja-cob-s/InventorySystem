Project for my BSCS program. Scenario was presented as follows: "You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. They have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program."

Program was built in JavaFX with GUI functionality with the ability to add, remove, and modify products from inventory. Products are associated with parts that can also be added, removed, or modified. Inventory levels and prices of parts and products can be adjusted and tracked. GUI has multiple screens and objects are passed from one screen to another.
